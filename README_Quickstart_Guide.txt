Full Forthttp NINAWI README IS HERE: https://github.com/txtatech/forthttp#readme

This is a quickstart guide only

Step 1:

Run:

forthhttp-main-release-alpha.exe

(OR)

Run:

forthhttpe-STABLE-DEBUG.exe

Step 2:

Use a web browser to open 

http://127.0.0.1:8080/

(OR)

http://localhost:8080/

Step 3: NOT A STEP JUST A REMINDER THAT THERE ARE MULTIPLE ZIPS

Make sure that all sub folders have their .zip files extracted.

Make sure 'static' and a sub-directory of it named 'images' are extracted correctly.

Step 4:

Open Dev Console:

Click or point the web browser to here:

http://127.0.0.1:8080/index.html

Step 5:

Click the 'Cache Qr Codes' link above the lower gear icon that is displayed at http://127.0.0.1:8080/index.html 

////// Commented Note http://127.0.0.1:8080/index.html is also the local directory http://127.0.0.1:8080/static/index.html 

Step 6:

Wait as the QR-Codes are loaded. Watch the Developer Tools Console because this can take some time depending on how many image files there are.

Once the process of caching the image files completes, move to the next step in this guide.

Step 7:

Click the 'To Main' link at the top of the page.

(OR)

Open the following in the web browser.

http://127.0.0.1:8080/index.html

Step 8:

Look in the Developer Tools Console and see that the workers have been loaded and are available and the site is up and running with a large codebase to work from.

Note on said 'codebase' it is for example purposes and is educational for low power and bandwidth needs.
Mostly the codebase is in ascii qr-code and .png qr-codes but also rust, javascript and forth which are the more primary loaders.

Step 9: Optional.

Tinker with the included .py scripts while either of the included .exe files are running.
